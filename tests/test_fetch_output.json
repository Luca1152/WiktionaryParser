Possibly a pet-form diminutive with suffix -ga (compare frocga (\u201cfrog\u201d), *picga (\u201cpig\u201d)), appended to a base *dog-, *doc- of unclear origin and meaning. One possibility is Old English dox (\u201cdark, swarthy\u201d) (compare frocga from frox). Another is Old Saxon <d\u00f4g> \"good\" (English dow, German taugen), the theory being that this could have been a commonly used epithet for dogs, especially by children. [3]In 14th-century England, hound (from Old English hund) was the general word for all domestic canines, and dog referred to a subtype resembling the modern mastiff and bulldog. By the 16th century, dog had become the general word, and hound had begun to refer only to breeds used for hunting. In the 16th century, the word dog was adopted by several continental European languages as their word for mastiff.",
